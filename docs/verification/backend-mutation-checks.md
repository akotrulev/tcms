# Deferred backend mutation checks — the queue

**Policy set 2026-08-02 (§65).** Mutation-verifying each slice inline costs a full `./gradlew build`
per mutation and was being paid *during* feature work, where it is slowest and least useful. It is
**deferred and batched**: a slice records the mutation it would have run, and this file is executed
as one pass later.

> **⚠ ZERO mutations run inline.** Every mutation a slice identifies is written here and run in the
> batch pass. None is "cheap enough" to run inline, and the fact that a run one has occasionally
> found something is not an argument for the exception — it is an argument for running this file.

**This does not lower the bar, it moves it.** The claim "this test would catch that defect" is still
required; it is just made checkable later. A slice that lands without adding its row here has
skipped the check outright. Sibling queue for the browser half: `frontend-browser-checks.md`.

## How to run this file

For each row: apply the mutation, run the named scope (never the whole suite), confirm **exactly**
the listed tests fail and nothing else, then revert.

```bash
cd backend
./gradlew test --tests '<the scope in the row>'
git checkout -- <the mutated file>          # revert by EXACT PATH, before the next row
```

**A mutation that reddens MORE than the listed tests is as much a finding as one that reddens
fewer.** Too few means the test does not cover the behaviour it claims; too many means the tests are
coupled to something other than what they name, and the extra failures are the ones worth reading.

**A row predicting zero reds is not a row to skip.** The measured number is the deliverable.

# RUN RECORD — 2026-08-05

**The queue was executed end to end.** 182 rows, backend only, on `4b582ec`. Baseline before and
after: `./gradlew build` green, **1756 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors**, 347 classes. Every mutation was
reverted by exact path; the backend ended byte-identical to `HEAD`.

| Outcome | Rows |
|---|---|
| MATCH — reddened exactly what the row predicted | 96 |
| MORE — reddened the predicted tests plus others | 26 |
| FEWER — reddened less than predicted | 8 |
| ZERO-AS-PREDICTED — row predicted 0, measured 0 | 13 |
| ZERO-UNEXPECTED — row predicted ≥1, measured 0 (**findings**) | 9 |
| STALE / STALE-BY-DESIGN — the code moved out from under the row | 6 |
| CONFIRMED by reading (no mutation needed) | 15 |
| BLOCKED-NO-ACCESS / NOT-SUITE-REPRODUCIBLE | 9 |

**No row reddened fewer tests than predicted for a reason that was a defect in the product.** Every
shortfall was a defect in the *test suite* or in the row's own reasoning. Those are below.

**Frontend rows in this file were not run** — they belong to `npx vitest` and are out of scope for a
backend pass. They are retained in §83, §85, §89, §90 and §96 phases 5–6 of the git history for
whoever runs them; see `f0279de` for the last version of this file carrying them in full.

# OPEN FINDINGS — what the pass actually discovered

Ordered by what a reader should act on first. Each is a place where a test is weaker than it reads,
not a place where the product is wrong.

## 1. `SuiteMembership#countsBySuite`'s `COUNT(DISTINCT c.id)` is vestigial, and its test says otherwise

Changing it to `COUNT(*)` reddens **nothing** across 106 tests. The three membership arms are
`EXISTS` subqueries inside one `ON` clause, so a case matching two arms still produces exactly one
join row — `COUNT(*)` is identically equal. `theCountIsTheWholeUnion`'s own comment claims *"a
`COUNT(*)` over the union answers 3 where the deduped count answers 2"*; it answers 2. **The dedup is
real but it comes from the `EXISTS` formulation, not from `DISTINCT`.** The test passes for a reason
that is not the one it states, and would keep passing if the query were later rewritten into a real
union that *does* duplicate. Fix the comment, or rewrite the test to pin the `EXISTS` shape.

## 2. The bulk path's condition attachments are asserted by nothing

Removing `|| authored` from `CaseBulkService#loadContext` is green across all 39 bulk tests. The
condition-side *absent-means-leave-alone* test only covers the single-case `PATCH`. So an authored
bulk action reconstructing a case with no attachments hashes it as though it had none, and the next
ordinary save is credited with restoring conditions nobody touched — §62's mis-attribution defect,
on a new field, with no test behind it. **Write it**: attach a condition, run `MOVE_TO_SUITE`, then
an ordinary title-only save whose version must not report the conditions as changed.

## 3. The same gap on classifications — `CaseEdit.of` with `Set.of()` reddens nothing

`CaseBulkEndpointTest` contains no occurrence of `classificationValueIds` or `case_classification`
at all, so its round-trip hash test runs over a case that carries no classification and the
reconstructed hash is identical either way. **The fixture needs a classified case**, not a new
mutation.

## 4. `PlanStatisticsEndpointTest` cannot see scope-predicate drift

Its fixture contains **no tag and no section**, so `theTwoDenominatorsAgree` is blind to the tag arm.
Drifting `caseCountsByPlan` away from the shared `scopeMatch()` string is caught (2 reds in
`PlanUpdateEndpointTest$TagArm`); drifting `casesInPlanScope` reddens **nothing anywhere**. Only the
plan-detail count is protected. Add a tag and a section to that fixture.

## 5. `FailingRepeatedlyTest`'s `LIMIT` test does not test the `LIMIT`

Deleting the inner `LIMIT CAST(:window AS bigint)` reddens **0**, though
`resultsOlderThanTheWindowAreIgnored`'s comment names itself *"the one that fails if the LIMIT is
dropped"*. `DEEP` is seeded `Passed, Failed, Failed, Failed` — with the LIMIT gone the predicate
still counts exactly 3 FAILED rows and `count = window` still holds. **The equality-with-window is
doing the LIMIT's job for this fixture.** Seed a case with failures *outside* the window.

## 6. `ReportDefinitionRepository`'s header claim is false

It states *"There is deliberately no method on this interface that can find a definition the caller
does not own."* It extends `JpaRepository<ReportDefinition, UUID>`, so **`findById` is inherited and
callable** — `definitions.findById(definitionId)` compiles with no edit. The absence is only of a
*declared* method. RLS bounds the inherited lookup to the company, not to the project or the owner.
Either the comment is wrong or the interface should not extend `JpaRepository`.

## 7. `ReportRenderingTest`'s `Header` and `Registries` cannot observe wiring

Both hand-build their subjects (`new ReportHeader(...)`, `new ReportRenderers(..., new
HtmlReportRenderer())`) rather than resolving from the context, so they are structurally incapable of
seeing a defect in `ReportHeaders.selection()` or in `@Component` wiring — two rows expecting "one
red per class" measured one, and the missing half was always this class. Only the pipeline/endpoint
tests can catch those.

## 8. M9's `WIP` status kind is unasserted

Dropping `WIP` from any of the three `case UNTESTED, RETEST, WIP ->` arms (`ExecutionViews:185`,
`SuiteHistoryService:127`, `PlanStatisticsService:400`), or dropping `&& kind != StatusKind.WIP` from
`PlanStatisticsService.isVerdict`, reddens **0 across 889 tests**. Java does not require statement
switches to be exhaustive, so a missing arm compiles clean and silently drops a count — or makes a
case somebody merely picked up count as *covered*, so coverage rises when a tester opens a screen.
The seed writes the row; nothing exercises it.

## 9. Two "mechanisms" are comments describing a path nothing walks

- **`PlanUpdateService`'s `scopeItems.flush()`** — dropping it reddens 0, and `plan_scope_item` has
  **no unique constraint on `(plan_id, suite_id)`** for an insert-before-delete ordering to collide
  on. The flush is a comment, not a mechanism.
- **`ReviewService.moved`'s idempotent open-review arm** — unreachable: an artifact already
  `IN_REVIEW` asked for `IN_REVIEW` is answered `Decision.Unchanged` one layer up. What actually
  protects `subject_version_no` is that the column is mapped `updatable = false`.

Neither is a defect. Both are places where a future reader could delete the comment's subject and see
nothing go red.

## 10. Smaller, but recorded

- **`ProjectRepository#countLiveCasesByProject`'s javadoc is wrong.** It claims `s.deleted_at IS
  NULL` "would silently keep the inner join's behaviour"; under a `LEFT JOIN` a non-match yields
  `NULL`, so that predicate is TRUE and the spelling is a **no-op**. The code is correct for a
  different reason than the comment gives.
- **Nothing asserts `project_settings.require_approved_plan_to_start` is gone.** `V32:203` drops it;
  `ddl-auto: validate` tolerates an extra column, so a `DROP COLUMN` that failed on a real database
  would go unobserved.
- **The resolution path's closed-review case has no test.** Removing `refuseIfClosed` from *both*
  comment paths reddens only the add-comment one. (The assignment side has both — §80 applied the
  repair to the new pair rather than retrofitting the old one.)
- **`CaseSummaries`' author resolution is held by one test, not two.** The second passes on fixture
  overlap: its author is also the *owner* of four other rows on the page, so the owner branch puts
  the id in `peopleIds` anyway.
- **No test authors a `=` or `!=` criterion**, so `PlanCriteria.isKnownOperator`'s delegation to
  `satisfies` can be replaced by a hard-coded four-operator set with nothing going red.
- **No test seeds a `DEPRECATED` case into a gated run**, so `<> 'APPROVED'` and
  `IN ('DRAFT','IN_REVIEW')` are indistinguishable to the suite — retired content could enter a
  release run.
- **The evidence storage key's composition is unasserted.** Appending the uploaded filename to it
  reddens nothing; traversal defence rests on the controller's sanitisation plus the adapter's
  `startsWith`, and only the first has a test.
- **Cross-query strongest-wins has no mutation behind it.** The `DISTINCT ON` mutation reddens 0
  because the two grants of the dual-grant persona land in two *different* queries; the merge is
  never given differing inputs. A mutation in `PermissionEvaluator.merge` would be the real one.
- **`ReportJobRunner`'s bytes-before-row ordering is unobservable**, as is `EvidenceService`'s
  opposite rows-before-bytes ordering. Both are argued at length in class headers and asserted
  nowhere; nothing in the suite makes a store write fail.

## 11. §98's flattening — six mutations, none run

The slice removed a column that four modules read, so most of its risk is in what silently keeps
compiling. Each row names the mutation and what it should redden; **none was run**, per §65.

| # | Mutation | What must redden |
|---|---|---|
| 11a | `CaseSpecifications.suiteScope` — delete the `scope.memberCaseIds() != null` branch, so a named suite falls through to `suite_id IN (…)` | **This is the slice's own defect, re-armed.** It reverts the grid to the filed arm while `caseCount` stays the union. `CaseListEndpointTest` must fail on a **tag-defined** suite. If it goes green, the fixture has no suite whose membership differs from its filing — which is exactly why the defect survived §96 and §97 unseen, and the row to fix first |
| 11b | `SuiteRepository.countLiveCasesFiledIn` — widen to the resolved membership | `SuiteWriteEndpointTest`'s delete-a-claiming-suite case must fail. The two readings are *deliberately* different and nothing but a test distinguishes them; if this reddens nothing, deleting a tag-defined suite could start 409ing on cases it does not hold |
| 11c | `CaseConditions.ancestry` — return `List.of()` unconditionally | A case must lose the conditions of the suite it is filed in. Suspected **weak**: the method now returns at most one suite, so the mutation is close to the whole feature, and the fixture attaches a condition to exactly one suite (`Refunds`) |
| 11d | `ExecutionSource` — change `('s' || s.key_seq)::ltree` to `NULL` | Suite-grouped report sections must move their rows into the `(not filed)` bucket. If nothing reddens, no report test covers a suite-grouped section over a **freshly projected** fact row, and the column's contents are unasserted for every row written after §98 |
| 11e | `SuiteRepository.findLiveForProject` — order by `position` instead of `keySeq` | `SuiteEndpointTest.orderingIsTotalAndStable`. Every fixture row has `position = 0`, so Postgres may return any order — meaning this mutation may pass **intermittently**, which is the honest expectation to record rather than a clean red |
| 11f | `CaseFacts.memberOf` — drop one of the three arms | `SuiteScopeAgreementTest`. It survived §98 (the plan expected it to be retired — the duplication is the module boundary's, not the subtree's), and the two predicates are now supposed to be **identical** rather than merely equivalent, so this should be its sharpest round |

**And one that cannot be run here at all:** `V33` drops two columns, and `ddl-auto: validate`
tolerates neither a missing one nor an extra one — but Testcontainers migrates a fresh container, so
a `DROP COLUMN` that failed against a real database with data would go unobserved. Same shape as
`V32`'s backfill row below, and it belongs to the Hetzner list.

---

# CLOSED — no longer owed

- **§69's `ProjectService.writeGrantedOnTarget` reordering is closed by construction.** The
  parameter is `Function<R, RequiredPermission>` and `R` is produced only by `resolve.apply(gated)`;
  moving the resolve below the permission check leaves `permission.apply(...)` with no argument in
  scope. The javadoc's claim — a caller whose row does not exist cannot be told 403 without the
  server inventing which permission they failed — is enforced by the **type signature**, which is
  stronger than a test.
- **§93's five "write these tests" rows are all COVERED today** by `PlanDocumentEndpointTest`:
  sibling-project subject 404, re-linking writes nothing, sibling project's case 404, both
  traceability 409s, and `level`'s three arms (the `Depth` class).
- **§97 phase 3b's `ck_plan_scope_target` assertion is written and green.**
  `PlanScopeConstraintTest` asserts both halves in both directions over plain JDBC as the application
  role, deliberately bypassing `PlanScopeItem`'s factories.
- **`DocPage#linkTo`'s entity guard is a live backstop, not dead code.** It reddens nothing on its
  own because the service's check answers first — but delete that branch and this guard is what
  fires (as a 500, not the 409). Do not remove it on the strength of a coverage report.
- **`SeedDataTest.everyReviewerIsAlsoACommenter` is not vacuous.** Its outer set is non-empty in the
  seeded catalogue, so a role granted a review key without `case:comment` would be selected.

# STILL OWED

## Needs the Hetzner box — migration-in-place checks

Testcontainers migrates a fresh container every time and **structurally cannot make these checks**.
None was attempted; all remain owed.

| Migration | What to show |
|---|---|
| `V20` | v19 → v20 in place, `installed_by = tcms_owner`, index present with `indpred` non-null and `company_id` leading |
| `V21` | v20 → v21; `uq_team_name` present as a unique **index** over `(company_id, lower(name))`, no longer a table constraint. Drops a constraint and creates an index in its place — the first to do so |
| `V22` | drops and re-adds `review_state_check`, adds two indexes; table has never held a row |
| `V23` | **the first migration since V1 to CREATE A TABLE.** Confirm the policy carries `V4`'s `nullif(...)` predicate and not `V1`'s, that `tcms_app` default privileges covered it without an explicit `GRANT`, and that the backfill left exactly one row per project |
| `V24`–`V28` | uneventful by expectation — which is the thing to confirm rather than assume |
| `V33` | **destructive, and the only one on this list that discards information.** Drops `suite.parent_id`, `suite.path` and `suite_path_idx` against a database that has them **with data in them**. Confirm: the GIST index is gone, the `ltree` extension **survives** (three other columns use it), `execution_fact.suite_path` is **byte-for-byte unchanged** including its dotted paths, and `ddl-auto: validate` boots afterwards. The parent-child relationships are gone for good — unlike `V32`'s lifecycle reduction, no audit event records them |
| `V32` | **the one that matters most.** Its status backfill runs inside a per-company `set_config` loop because `test_plan` is under `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. Verified here that removing the loop leaves the migration **green on a fresh container** — a fresh database has no `ACTIVE`/`CLOSED` row to backfill, so the bare `UPDATE` touches zero rows and reports success. **That is V7's shape exactly.** Only a restored dump can check it |

Also owed on a real box: `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE)` on the step-suggestion query, to confirm
`test_step_action_trgm_idx` is actually chosen. Confirmed by reading that it is spelled on the
**expression** `lower(action)` and not the bare column — the two V1 siblings
(`shared_step_title_trgm_idx`, `condition_title_trgm_idx`) still have the wrong spelling, deliberately.

## Not reproducible through the suite

- **`V22`'s partial unique index under a race.** Two concurrent `PUT …/status` submissions of one
  artifact: one must succeed and one must fail on `uq_review_open_per_subject`. Needs two interleaved
  transactions; MockMvc cannot express it.
- **`review_assignment`'s cascade on a real database** — deleting a `team` row must remove its
  `review_assignment` rows and nothing else. The in-suite half
  (`deletingATeamCascadesOntoItsRequests`) is green.

## Tests to write

Each is a gap this pass measured rather than a guess. Numbered findings above give the reasoning.

1. A classified case in `CaseBulkEndpointTest`'s fixture (finding 3).
2. A condition attached across a bulk action (finding 2).
3. A tag and a section in `PlanStatisticsEndpointTest`'s fixture (finding 4).
4. A `DEEP` case with failures outside the window (finding 5).
5. A `WIP` execution asserted through `notRun` and through coverage (finding 8).
6. A `DEPRECATED` case seeded into a gated run.
7. A criterion authored with `=` / `!=`.
8. A fault-injecting `EvidenceStore` and `ReportStore`, to make both storage orderings observable
   (finding 9's third cousin) — each needs its own slice.
9. Step corpus: a ~5k-step project answering a 3-character `q` in typeahead time; and the corpus
   after a case is edited.
10. Conditions: the edit under real concurrency (two readers at version *n*, one 200 and one 409);
    and an edit to a condition attached to a **suite**, reaching cases added after the edit.
11. Plan scope widening end to end: a plan scoped on a tag-defined suite, a run created from it, and
    the executions materialised.
12. A retired condition attachment surviving a save that cannot mention it
    (`CaseConditions.reconcile`'s `!live.contains(...)` guard — currently uncovered).

# CORRECTIONS TO THIS FILE'S OWN FACTS

The pass found the queue's stated invariants had drifted. Superseded, with the reason:

- ~~"`V22` / `V26` / `V27` / `V28` / `V29` / `V30` / `V31` is the next free number"~~ → **head is
  `V32__plan_sections_scope_prose_and_lifecycle.sql`; `V33` is next free.**
- ~~"`SchemaConventionTest` asserts 56 / 57 / 58 / 59 policies"~~ → **61**
  (`SchemaConventionTest:263`).
- ~~§73's *"CLOSED is reachable only from ACTIVE"* row~~ and ~~§82's whole plan-side approval gate~~
  → **STALE-BY-DESIGN.** §97 phase 3a reduced the plan ladder to `DRAFT → IN_REVIEW → APPROVED` and
  deleted `PlanLifecycle.startsWithoutApproval`, `PlanLifecycle.isClosed`, `test_plan.closed_at`,
  `project_settings.require_approved_plan_to_start` and `PlanStatusInput.overrideApprovalGate`. §6g's
  **case** gate (`requireApprovedCaseForRun`) survives and still binds. §73's gate row consequently
  reddens 2 where it predicted 3 — the missing third named the `ACTIVE` state.
- ~~§93's row scoping `PlanDocumentEndpointTest$Lifecycle`~~ → the nested class is **`$Adoption`**.
- ~~§97 phase 3b's row naming `PlanStatisticsTest`~~ → the class is **`PlanStatisticsEndpointTest`**.
- ~~§97 phase 3a's *"four statement switches consume `StatusKind`"*~~ → there are **three**; the
  fourth reference is `isVerdict`.
- ~~§95's rows scoping the usage-count tests to `ConditionWriteEndpointTest`~~ → they live in
  **`ConditionLibraryEndpointTest`**; the blanket scope would have under-measured them.
- ~~§68's *"a 500 from V2's `23505`"*~~ → the raise is the trigger's own `RAISE` with its explanatory
  message, not a bare unique-violation SQLSTATE. The layer and failure class are as predicted.

# THE MUTATION THAT CANNOT BE WRITTEN, AND WHY IT IS RECORDED

Swapping the team gate's key from `company:teams` to `company:members` reddens **nothing**. `V3`
grants both to exactly the same roles, so every persona the suite can build holds both or neither:
the distinction is real in the code and unobservable in the seeded data.

That is not repaired by inventing a fixture role — it is recorded by
`SeedDataTest.teamManagementAndMemberManagementAreStillHeldTogether`, which fails the day a role
holds one without the other. **When it fails, that is the good case**: the discrimination has become
observable and the repair is to add that persona to `TeamEndpointTest.Gate`, not to re-align the
seed. The frontend carries the only test that can tell the two keys apart today
(`TeamsPage.test.tsx`), because a test can mock a permission set the seed cannot produce.

The counter-examples are worth naming beside it, because they are what a *discriminating* gate looks
like: `run:close` vs `result:submit`, `plan:approve` vs `plan:edit`, `suite:approve` vs
`suite:manage`, `case:comment` vs `plan:review`, and — only because §87 inserted the suite's first
two custom PROJECT-scope roles — `report:view` vs `report:export`. Each has a persona the suite can
build that holds one and not the other, and each swap reddens exactly the tests that name it.
